# Hololens-OBJRenderer

##Render an OBJ

Currently, the project is unable to save/load the app state. What this means for anyone using the code is that they want to do the following:

 1. Press **F5** to run the Visual Studio project to start the Hololens emulator (the program will reach a point where it forces you to break, do not worry I will add a fix for this issue later)
 2. Click **Open Device Portal** in the toolbar located just to the right of the emulator
 3. In the window that is opened, under **System**,click **File Explorer**
 4. Choose **LocalAppData**. Choose **Hololens-OBJRenderer** and then click on **LocalState**.
 5. Upload the **bunny.obj** file located in **..\Hololens-OBJRenderer\Assets**.
 6. Wait a minute and enjoy a rotating bunny
